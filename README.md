# React + TypeScript + Vite + SASS

## Assignment One: App Two

I made a desktop animal friend that gives you advice. 

When the user clicks the button a call to an API is made, and depending on if the request has been fully processed a loading component is shown which is made using framer-motion. With this small application I had some fun making the button interactive on hover and on active using the corresponding css pseudo-classes. It also includes react components and props to structure the files in a more readable way. 

I also tried unit-testing using Jest for the first time! It was a fun and challenging task to do on my own with a bit of help from google. 

This assignment was part of the Web & App development course.
